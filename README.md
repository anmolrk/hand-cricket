In the game of "Hand Cricket" players simultaneously throw one to ten hand signs representing one to ten score The winner is determined by the rules:
First, the player tosses to see if the sum of both player hand scores is odd or even. The person who wins the toss chooses between bat and bowl first, and the player doing the batting hand score counts until the player gets out with the same hand gesture and comes to the bowler side. In this project, we play this game with a computer using a Python script that randomly selects between one to ten.
